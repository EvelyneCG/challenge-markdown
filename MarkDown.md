#### You can always count on me when

Someone needs help, if I can help you then I'll help with big pleasure (Hope you'll help me too).
I'm super hyped to be in the training and to learn all I can in coding.
Sometimes it's hard but I'm doing my best to understand as much as I can by myself. I'm not afraid to ask if I need help. So be aware of that guys.

##### A funny story
I'm a crazy person, for example, in my head there is 18746 people living in buildings created by my little brain but we're all loving each others and have a happy life even if we need more unicorns but that's not the point...

###### TL;DR
My psychiatrist says as long as I don't bite anyone I can see people.
